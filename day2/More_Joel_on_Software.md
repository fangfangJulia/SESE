*Avram Joel Spolsky* (born 1965) is a software engineer and writer. He is the author of Joel on Software, a blog on software development. He was a Program Manager on the Microsoft Excel team between 1991 and 1994. He later founded Fog Creek Software in 2000 and launched the Joel on Software blog.

Since the release of the bestselling title Joel on Software in 2004, requests for a sequel have been relentless. So, we went back to the famed 
JoelonSoftware.com archives and pulled out a new batch of favorites, many of which have been downloaded over one million times. With Joel’s new
est book, More Joel on Software, you’ll get an even better (not to mention updated) feast of Joel’s opinions and impressions on software develo
pment, software design, running a software business, and so much more.

This is a new selection of essays from the author’s web site, <http://www.joelonsoftware.com>.

Joel Spolsky started his weblog in March 2000 in order to offer his insights, based on years of experience, on how to improve the world of prog
ramming. This weblog has become infamous among the programming world, and is linked to more than 600 other web sites and translated into 30+ la
nguages!

Spolsky’s extraordinary writing skills, technical knowledge, and caustic wit have made him a programming guru. With the success of Joel on Soft
ware, there has been a strong demand for additional gems and advice, and this book is the answer to those requests.

Containing a collection of all–new articles from the original, More Joel on Software has even more of an edge than the original, and the tips f
or running a business or managing people have far broader application than the software industry. We feel it is safe to say that this is the mo
st useful book you will buy this year.

What you’ll learn

*       The best approaches to managing and hiring extraordinary people
*       Advice for those interested in the software industry as a career and for managers who want to get them
*       Joel’s unique impressions of how to create products and design—good and bad
*       An “in the trenches” look at how to start and run an effective software business (or any business for that matter)
*       A true sense of what it takes to create a differentiated, unique, motivated organization

Who this book is for

Anyone interested in the software business will truly enjoy this book, but in particular this should be required reading for managers of techni
cal businesses.
