<h1>what is an abstract</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The abstract is an important component of your thesis. Presented at the beginning of the thesis, it is likely the first substantive description of your work read by an external examiner. You should view it as an opportunity to set accurate expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>The abstract is a summary of the whole thesis. It presents all the major elements of your work in a highly condensed form.</p></li>
<li><p>An abstract often functions, together with the thesis title, as a stand-alone text. Abstracts appear, absent the full text of the thesis, in bibliographic indexes such as PsycInfo. They may also be presented in announcements of the thesis examination. Most readers who encounter your abstract in a bibliographic database or receive an email announcing your research presentation will never retrieve the full text or attend the presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>An abstract is not merely an introduction in the sense of a preface, preamble, or advance organizer that prepares the reader for the thesis. In addition to that function, it must be capable of substituting for the whole thesis when there is insufficient time and space for the full text.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>size &amp; structure</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>the maximum sizes for abstracts submitted to Canada's National Archive are 150 words (Masters thesis) and 350 words (Doctoral dissertation).</p></li>
<li><p>limit the abstract for doctoral dissertation to one double-spaced page, about 280 words.</p></li>
<li><p>An abstract word limit of 150 to 200 words is common.</p></li>
<li><p>The structure of the abstract should mirror the structure of the whole thesis, and should represent all its major elements.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Parts of an Abstract</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Motivation: </p>

<pre><code>Why do we care about the problem and the results? If the problem isn't obviously "interesting" it might be better to put motivation first; but if your work is incremental progress on a problem that is widely recognized as important, then it is probably better to put the problem statement first to indicate which piece of the larger problem you are breaking off to work on. This section should include the importance of your work, the difficulty of the area, and the impact it might have if successful.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Problem statement: </p>

<pre><code>What problem are you trying to solve? What is the scope of your work (a generalized approach, or for a specific situation)? Be careful not to use too much jargon. In some cases it is appropriate to put the problem statement before the motivation, but usually this only works if most readers already understand why the problem is important.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Approach:</p>

<pre><code>How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product? What was the extent of your work (did you look at one application program or a hundred programs in twenty different programming languages?) What important variables did you control, ignore, or measure?
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Results:</p>

<pre><code>What's the answer? Specifically, most good computer architecture papers conclude that something is so many percent faster, cheaper, smaller, or otherwise better than something else. Put the result there, in numbers. Avoid vague, hand-waving results such as "very", "small", or "significant." If you must be vague, you are only given license to do so when you can talk about orders-of-magnitude improvement. There is a tension here in that you should not provide numbers that can be easily misinterpreted, but on the other hand you don't have room for all the caveats.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Conclusions: </p>

<pre><code>What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (all of the previous results are useful). Are your results general, potentially generalizable, or specific to a particular case?
